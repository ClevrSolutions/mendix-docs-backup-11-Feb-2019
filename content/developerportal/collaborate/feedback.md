## 1 Introduction

Within Mendix, there are two use-cases for the Feedback widget:

* To provide feedback on the Mendix Platform
* To provide feedback via the app

In the **Developer Portal**, you can view and manage the feedback about your app by clicking **Feedback** in the **Collaborate** category.

Feedback can go through the following four stages:

Stage | Description
| --- | --- |
**Open** | The feedback is awaiting a response from the App Team.
**Handled** | The App Team has looked into the feedback and has respond for further information.
**Accepted** | The App Team has accepted the feedback and added this feedback as a story to the sprint.
**Closed** | The App Team has closed the feedback.

Feedback in each stage is shown in a separate tab.

Each feedback item can be one of three types:

Type | Description
| --- | --- |
**Idea** | The feedback is an idea for a change or new feature.
**Question** | The feedback is a question.
**Issue** | The feedback is an issue or a bug.

### 4.1 Actions

You can manage the feedback item with the following actions:

Action | Description
| --- | --- |
**Accept feedback** | Means this feedback is valid and that you want to add a story to your backlog on the basis of this item.
**Mark 'Under review'** | Notifies the user who submitted the feedback and your team that the item is under review.
**Mark as handled** | Changes the status of the item from open to handled so that the item will not pollute your open items list.
**Close feedback** | Closes the feedback (for example, when the item is already solved or a duplicate has already been accepted).

### 4.2 Convert

If the feedback type is not correct, you can convert it afterwards by selecting one of these options:

Convert type | Description
| --- | --- |
**Convert to idea** | Changes the feedback type to an idea.
**Convert to question** | Changes the feedback type to a question.
**Convert to issue** | Changes the feedback type to an issue.

### 4.3 Move to App

This option allows you to move a particular feedback item to another app.

You are only allowed to move a feedback item to an app in which you are already a team-member.

### 4.4 Delete

When clicking **Delete feedback**, be sure that you want to delete that feedback item, because this will remove all the associated messages as well.

This action cannot be undone.
